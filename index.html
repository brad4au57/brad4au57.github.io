  <h1>About Me:</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Brad Bales, and I am a full-stack web developer based out of Birmingham, AL. In early 2017, I decided it was time I made a career change and chose to pursue a field in which I felt more enthusiasm. My educational background provided me a Bachelor's in Science from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. While pursuing my degree and after completion, I worked in multiple professional settings from support to leadership roles, but I found myself wanting more out of my work. </p>
  <p>Through personal introspection and discussion among my friends and family, my efforts lead me to the Full-Stack program at my local college. Once starting the Full-Stack program, I knew instantly that I had a newfound passion. Since starting the program, I have continually sought to expand my knowledge of scripting and coding with the help of my instructors, experts in the field, and all the great scripting &amp; coding communities online. My insatiable thirst for knowledge has allowed me to quickly learn a good foundation in web development which I hope to put to good use with a future employer.</p>
  <p>When I'm not working on broadening my grasp of scripting &amp; coding, I enjoy some of my other hobbies and pasttimes which include playing guitar and piano, gaming, traveling, sports spectating, and socializing with friends. I always try to keep myself open to new opportunities in my professional life, so if you are interested in working with me, please feel free to contact me. I woud love to hear from you!   </p>
